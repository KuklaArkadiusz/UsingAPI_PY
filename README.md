# UsingAPI_PY
This was recruitment task where i had to use API and get 5 articles out of 3 categories from Hacker News site. 

## main problems:
*If there is any duplicate between categories remove them and pick another title. \
*Program should dispaly title and URL, but if there is no URL it should strip HTML tags and print first 80 words
